'''
Write a function named joinList(aList, separator) where aList is a list and separator is a string. 
The function must return a string that concatenates all items in aList using the separator between them.
For example, assume that aList=["apple",7,"mango","orange"]
joinList(aList,":") must return "apple:7:mango:orange"
'''

def joinList(alist, separator):
    string = alist[0]
    for i in range(1, len(alist)):
        string += separator + str(alist[i])
    print(string)
    return string
    
'''
Write a function named joinTable(table, outer, inner) where table is a list of lists and outer and inner
are two strings representing two separators. The function must join the table into a string such that the 
elements within a list are separated by inner and different lists are combined using the separator outer. For
example, assume that table=[["apple",7],["mango",12],["orange",3]]
joinTable(table,";","$") must return apple$7;mango$12;orange$3
'''

def joinTable(table, outer, inner):
    alist = []
    for item in table:
        alist.append(joinList(item, inner))
    return joinList(alist, outer)

joinTable([['apple',7],['mango',12],['orange',3]], ';', '$')
