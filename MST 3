'''
Write a function named getProduct(text) where text is a string showing the product of several positive integers.
The function must evaluate the expression in text and return the answer. For example, if text = "12*2*10" then 
getProduct(text) must return 24. You can assume that text is always a valid expression and will not contain 
any character other than digits and power, floats etc are all invalid. You are NOT allowed to use the built-in
function split() to write getProduct(text).
'''
def getProduct(text):
    value = ""
    product = 1
    for i in range(len(text)):
        if text[i] == '*':
            product *= int(value)
            value = ""
        else:
            value += text[i]

    product *= int(value)
    print(product)
    return product

'''
Write a function named evaluate(text) where text is a string showing product and sum of several positive 
integers. The function must evaluate the expression in text and return the answer. For example, the text 
"4*2*3*1+2*10+1*2*3" then evaluate(text) must return 50. You are allowed to use the built in split() function 
for writing evaluate(text). Your function must effectively utilize getProduct(text) function you wrote in the previous part, wherever
it makes sense to do so
'''
def evaluate(text):
    text = text.split('+')
    a = 0
    for item in text:
        a += getProduct(item)
    print(a)
    return a

evaluate("4*2*3*1+2*10+1*2*3")
